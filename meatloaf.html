                    <li>1/3 cup whole milk</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 pounds ground beef chuck</li>
                    <li>1/2 pound ground pork</li>
                    <li>1/2 medium onion, grated</li>
                    <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
                    <li>1 large egg</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup ketchup</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup Heinz 57 sauce</li>
                    <li>coarse salt and ground pepper</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Directions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 400&deg;. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper.
                        Place bread in food processor; pulse until fine crumbs form. Transfer to a small bowl;
                        stir in milk. Set aside, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, in a small bowl combine the ketchup and Heinz 57; in a large bowl, combine beef, 
                        pork, onion, garlic, egg, 1/4 cup of the ketchup and 57 mixture, 1 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
                        Add bread-milk mixture, and mix very gently with a fork (do not overmix).</li>
                    <li>Place meat mixture on prepared baking sheet, and form into a loaf about 9 inches long and 4 to 5 inches wide.</li>
                    <li>Bake, brushing twice with the remaining ketchup-57 mixture during baking, until an instant-read thermometer registers
                        160&deg;, 45 to 55 minutes. Let meatloaf rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Tasty Extras</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bacon</li>
                    Before baking, lay 8 slices of bacon crosswise over the meatloaf, slightly overlapping.
                    Using a thin metal spatula or dinner knife, tuck ends of bacon under the meatloaf.
                    <li>Crispy Onions</li>
                    Before baking, toss 1 halved and thinly sliced small onion with 1 teaspoon of olive oil.
                    Sprinkle on top of meatloaf, pressing in slightly (onions will be piled quite high).
                    <li>Cheddar</li>
                    Before forming meatloaf, gently mix 1/2 cup finely grated heddar into meat mixture.
                    Before baking, sprinkle another 1/2 cup cheese on top of meatloaf.
                </ul>
